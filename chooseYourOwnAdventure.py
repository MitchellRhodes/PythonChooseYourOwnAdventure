#Movement direction is crucial here â€“ you must create walls and set the directions in which the users can move through the rooms, set movement restrictions, 
# and also include a tracker that can track how far a user has walked or moved in the game. Mentioning Python projects can help your resume look much more interesting 
# than others.
